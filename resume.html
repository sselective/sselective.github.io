  <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Introduction</h2>
  <p>My name is Sean Mourdhuj and I am a first-year Software Engineering student from Western Sydney University. I would like to create tidy and efficient software, while investigating the application of technology to solve problems in the real world. This site and portfolio embody my early career, including my technical abilities, evolving experience, and aspirations as a software engineer of the future. From university, my personal projects, and self-directed study, I am developing the foundations of technical understanding and teamwork capabilities required in IT in the current environment.</p>

  <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Skills &amp; Learning</h2>
  <p>During the past twelve months, I have been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make front-end web pages with responsive design and accessibility. I have also learned a bit about version control using Git and GitHub, which I use frequently to keep track of progress and publish web projects. One of the projects I developed a relational SQL database, named "SnapEats". While developing it, I learned about using primary and foreign keys to relate tables, normalization of the data, and how to write a structured query to extract and analyze the data.</p>
  <p>In addition to code projects, I have been reporting Python, by developing an interactive quiz program that tested  user's math and logic skills while gaining an understanding of loops, variables, and functions. Each project helped me develop more logical thinking and problem solving habits that I still use for working on larger software projects.</p>

  <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Experience with Projects</h2>
  <p>My projects exhibit my growth in both creativity and technology. The second program I wrote was the Python Quiz Game, which helped build my confidence writing structured code. I tested my limits of creativity by adding features such as score tracking, replay functionality, and input validation, learning to think like a developer and think about how users would interact with the program.</p>
  <p>I created the SnapEats Database project in my database design course. The project introduced me to ER diagram design and writing a SQL schema for a food delivery platform. I enjoyed writing queries and testing them to extract specific insights from the data. Specific code language to define relationships gave me a strong understanding of how a software interacts with a database and was definitely something I can use in my future back-end development.</p>
  <p>Finally, this GitHub portfolio project demonstrates my ability to deploy a website with GitHub Pages, uploading and maintaining repositories, and presenting my work in a professional manner. I'm proud of my ability to design a user-friendly interface with Bootstrap 5 and CSS, and document my project for future employments or collaborative environments.</p>

  <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Career Goals &amp; Reflection</h2>
  <p>Studying Software Engineering has allowed me to realize that programming is more than just writing code &mdash; it involves problem solving, collaboration, and learning throughout one's lifetime. My career aspirations include becoming a full-stack developer or working in the realm of artificial intelligence &mdash; combining creativity with technical depth.</p>
  <p>I have also learned about the necessity of inter-team communication and the importance of using version control in teams, and I intend to continue to grow as a collaborator and leader in group projects. I foresee myself participating in internships and placements over the next couple of years to practice experience in professional environments.</p>
  <p>Building this website has demonstrated how far I have come in a short period of time from writing very basic Python scripts to publishing a portfolio that works. I'm inspired to learn and grow as a software engineer so that I can make a positive difference in the world, either through technology or society as a whole.</p>
