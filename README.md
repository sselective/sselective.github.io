# Sean — Resume Website (Bootstrap)

Edit the HTML pages to add your content (About, Resume, Projects, Contact).

## How to publish (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
2. Make a repository named **username.github.io** (replace `username` with your GitHub username).
3. Upload all files from this folder to that repository and commit.
4. In repo **Settings → Pages**, set Branch to **main** and folder to **/(root)**. Save.
5. Wait up to a couple minutes, then click **Visit site**. Your site will be at `https://username.github.io`.

## What to customise
- Replace placeholder images in `/img`.
- Fill out each page with professional, proofread content (~1000‑word equivalent across the site).
- Update the mailto address in `contact.html`.
- Export your resume to PDF and drop it in the root as `Sean_Resume.pdf` (or change the link).
- Check accessibility: keyboard navigation, alt text, colour contrast.
- Validate HTML/CSS and test on mobile + desktop.

## Submission
- Paste your live site URL to vUWS as required by the assignment.
- Keep your repo Public so markers can view your code.
